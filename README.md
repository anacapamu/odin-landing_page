# Odin Landing Page

## Description
Static landing page for a fictional aquarium.

## Context
The goal of this project is to create a landing page of a website in order to review concepts from the foundations of HTML, CSS, and flexbox lessons. The design is based on the wireframe provided in the [project requirement](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).


## Project Status
This project will no longer be updated after **March 18, 2023**.

Can this project be improved? Definitely. Is this landing page responsive? No. But this is my second ever coding project and the first one I was really proud of, so it holds a special place in my heart.
