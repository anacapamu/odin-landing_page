# odin-landing_page

The goal of this project is to create a landing page of a website in order to review concepts from the foundations of HTML, CSS, and flexbox sections of The Odin Project.

I will first attempt to recreate the example (linked below for reference) provided with the exact same colors and fonts.

After successfully recreating the layout, I will attempt to substitute my own content into the design.
